Project Title: StudySync Tasks — Real-Time Course-Based Group To-Do App

Goal: Build a complete full-stack web application where university students can create shared, course-specific task lists with real-time synchronization, authentication, and a modern responsive UI.

🧱 Tech Stack (Required)

Frontend: React (Hooks + functional components)

Backend/Cloud: Firebase Firestore (real-time database)

Authentication: Firebase Auth (Email + Password)

Hosting: Firebase Hosting

📌 Core Features to Implement
1. User Authentication

User registration + login

Fields: email, password, display name

Email verification must be implemented

Bonus (if possible): “Forgot Password” reset email

After login → redirect to dashboard

2. Course-Based Task Management (CRUD)

Users can create and interact with tasks inside specific course groups.

Task fields:

Title (required)

Description (optional)

Due Date (optional)

Priority (Low / Medium / High)

Assigned To (self or course group member)

Status (completed / pending)

Required operations:

Create task

Edit task

Mark complete/incomplete

Delete task

View task list with:

Filtering (status, assignee, priority)

Sorting (due date, priority)

3. Real-Time Cloud Synchronization (Critical Feature)

Use Firebase Firestore onSnapshot listeners

Any update made by one student must instantly update for all group members without page refresh

Data structure should follow:

Users -> Courses -> Tasks

4. Frontend UI Requirements

Create a clean, modern SPA with the following pages:

Login / Register page

Dashboard: shows overview of tasks across all courses

Course Page: displays only tasks related to that specific course

Task creation/edit forms

Clear distinction between completed and pending tasks

Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)

Styling can use:

Tailwind CSS OR basic CSS modules

🎁 Bonus Features (If possible)

Include any of these if time allows:

Push notifications for assigned tasks or approaching deadlines

File attachments (stored in Firebase Storage)

Comments/discussion thread inside each task

Data visualization (charts showing completed tasks per course)

Drag-and-drop task ordering

Offline capability via service workers

📦 Project Output Expectations

Replit should generate:

A fully functional React + Firebase app following best practices (components, hooks, context, etc.)

A modular file structure such as:

src/
  components/
  pages/
  hooks/
  context/
  firebase/
  utils/


Fully working CRUD and real-time sync

README with setup instructions

Firebase config template

Deployment instructions for Firebase Hosting

🚀 Final Instruction

Build the entire application following the specs above with clean, commented code and a professional UI.
